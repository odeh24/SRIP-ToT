# Arduino Board definitions for the ATmega128RFA1 Development Board

The _sparkfun_ folder should be added to a *hardware* directory within your Arduino sketchbook. Normally the sketchbook will install to your documents/Arduino folder. If a *hardware* folder isn't already there, make it.

This directory contains a *boards.txt* file which defines the ATmega128RFA1 Dev Board, and adds a selectable option under the *Tools > Board* menu. When you open the Arduino ID (close and reopen if it's already open), this option should be added to the menu.
